## Estimating Synaptic Conductances By Learning Neuron Dynamics

Neurons are sophisticated IO machines which allow extraditing their relevant dynamics through various approaches. Since the adoption of now wide-spread machine learning methods, there has been a great interest in drwaing parallels between biological and artificial units of computation. Here we consider 4 different single neuron models (Moris-Lecar 2D, FitzHugh-Nagumo 2D, FitzHugh-Nagumo-Rinzel 3D, Wang 4D) and utilize 3 different neural architectures (Wavenet, Transformer, CNN) in portraying these models dynamics.

## System Requirements

The bulk of the training and testing in this work is carried out on a NVIDIA 4070 GPU using pytorch library.
<br>

ODE dynamics of neuronal models are investigated using xpp-auto.
